                Waren Buffet gave a very important advice that everyone that earns money. He stated that people needed to cultivate
                habit of spending what is left after he or she must have set his/her savings aside. This is a turn around from the 
                natural inclination of always wanting to settle all your needs and want immediiately that monthly pay comes in. Most
                people will agree over time that this advice is top notch and could be the line between becoming poor and financial
                stable.
